# GGS & SRM Collaborative Projects - Context & Expectations

> **A Collaborative Learning Initiative between GGS Information Services & SRM Institute**

---

## <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Timeline & Scope</span>

- **Suggested Timeline:** All project durations are proposed by the GGS team based on initial understanding. These serve as guiding frameworks, not rigid deadlines.

- **Discovery Phase Flexibility:** As we dive deeper into requirements and technical discovery, scope may evolve. This is natural and healthy — we'll adapt together to ensure the best outcome.

---

## <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Learning-First Approach</span>

- **Student Development Focus:** These projects are designed to help SRM students gain hands-on industry experience while delivering real value to GGS. We'll factor in:
  - Academic schedules (exams, study periods)
  - Learning curves for new technologies
  - Mentorship and review cycles

- **Building Future-Ready Talent:** Every challenge is a teaching moment. Quality and learning take priority over rushing to deadlines.

## <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Collaboration Dynamics</span>

- **Multi-Stakeholder Coordination:** Success depends on smooth collaboration between:
  - SRM Students & Faculty
  - GGS Technical & Business Teams

- **Scheduling Realities:** We acknowledge that professors and GGS contacts have competing priorities. Timeline adjustments or scope refinements may be needed — and that's perfectly okay.

| Principle                         | What It Means                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regular Check-ins**             | Weekly sync ensures alignment, catches issues early     |
| **MVP Mindset**                   | Deliver working core first, enhance later               |
| **Documentation as Deliverable**  | Students document learnings — useful for future batches |
| **Success = Learning + Delivery** | Both matter equally                                     |
